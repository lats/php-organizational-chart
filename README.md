# php-organizational-chart
- The chart portion is a slightly modified version of https://github.com/Awesomez/PHP-to-OrgChart
- Everything else has been more or less hand written with no specific variable conventions in mind. 
//The code looks a bit messy.

# Todo: 
- Clean-up the code and make the variables more uniform.
- "Fix" the skill list to make it work the way it is supposed to; Categories nest children and can be collapsed/expanded to reveal/hide those children.
